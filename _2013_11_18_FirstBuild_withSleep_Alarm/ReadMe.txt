 My first stable datalogger build for a Tinyduino stack consisting of: a processor board, a BMA250 accelerometer sheild,  the microSD adapter, and a protoboard, jumpered to a chronodot RTC. The whole thing runs ‘unregulated’ off of 3 AA batteries, so I keep an eye on the bandgap voltage to (hopefully) stop data writes to the SD card when the battery voltage gets too low. But this part has not been tested yet, so don’t trust your life, or data for your thesis, to that kludge. Build yourself a real voltage divider!

 This scrapbook of code was cobbled together from the work of other people who actually know what they are doing, and my only real contribution was the hours I spent wading through forum threads collecting examples, before bolting this Frankenstein together.  So I take no credit for any of it, and provide no guarantees whatsoever that it wont brick your system the first time you run it. I also hope that anyone I’ve missed in the credits, forgives the accidental oversight, as some details get lost in the process of all that cutting and pasting.

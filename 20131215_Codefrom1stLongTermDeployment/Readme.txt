This code was loaded on December 15th, 2013 for the first long term deployment of the two "Beta" Cave Pearl dataloggers, which survived till their successful retrieval in March 2014. 

To reduce sd card witing, this script buffers 3 data read cycles before each SD card write cycle with the simplest method possible – I created two more sets of variables to hold the data. 

Later versions of the codebuild have more elegant data handling.

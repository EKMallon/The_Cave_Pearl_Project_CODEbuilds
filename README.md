# The_Cave_Pearl_Project_OLD_codebuilds
Functional datalogger code builds, but hardware will change between builds, so read the comments.

These are OLD builds that show the development leading up to the code currently used 
for the Cave Pearl Project data loggers. The base code evolved from a fairly crude 
starting point, and these various versions were successfully deployed in the field.    
They are posted here primarily as a teaching reference for Dr. Beddows instrumentation course students, 
and have various library dependencies which may make them inoperable at the current time 
without significant de-bugging.
